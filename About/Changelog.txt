========================
Rewrite and fully rebase code onto 1.0 RimWorld, fixing several bugs. Engineered by lbmaian.
- fixes pathing issues, including enemies warping through large doors
- forbid/unforbid has immediate effect (instead of having to wait a tick)
- fixes behavior inconsistent with vanilla doors, including default door opening/closing speeds, previously held open door closing behavior, whether enemies set fire to doors, heat transfer rates through open/closed doors
- allow <1.0 fillPercent doors with correct cover/snow/etc. calculations
- doors are non-minifiable (non-uninstallable) by default
- doors block light by default
- remote doors default to non-remotely secured
- remote hold open state now linked to remote button/lever, with latter's state initialized to first linked remote door
- remote hold open state no longer clobbers native hold open state (in case door is unlinked)
- secured remotely doors ignore native hold open state (and disables hold open gizmo)
- custom remote door gizmos now appear right after hold open gizmo
- more consistent messages on button connect/disconnect
- dev mode inspector has new toggles (write temperature, write edifice grid, write doors), more path info, and patch call registry for debugging
